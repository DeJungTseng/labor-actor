# Vision: You Are Not Alone

Labor-actor is not a chatbot that tells people to endure.
It is a system that reminds people they are not fighting alone.

When someone feels they cannot breathe anymore,
Labor-actor does not judge, optimize, or push productivity.

It helps them see:
- available resources
- existing rights
- possible next steps
- real humans and institutions that can help

The goal is not to escalate conflict.
The goal is to **prevent silent collapse**.

Labor-actor stands at the gap between:
- law and lived experience
- policy and real life
- support systems and people who cannot reach them in time
