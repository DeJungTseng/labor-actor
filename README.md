# Labor-actor 🐕‍🦺

**Labor-actor** is an AI-powered worker support system designed to help people
who are facing workplace stress, unfair treatment, or sudden job loss.

When someone feels overwhelmed or alone, Labor-actor helps them:
- understand what might be happening
- find real-world support resources
- take the next possible step
- and remember they are not alone

## Why Labor-actor?

Many workers do not lack intelligence or effort.
They lack **clear entry points** to the systems meant to protect them.

Labor-actor exists to reduce friction between people in crisis and:
- labor unions
- legal aid and labor lawyers
- mental health resources
- government subsidies and support systems

This project is built as a **public-interest, non-extractive AI system**.
